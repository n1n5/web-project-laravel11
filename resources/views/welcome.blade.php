                    <p class="mb-0"><strong>Mankind in its present state has been around for a quarter of a million
                            years, yet only a small fraction of that has been of any significance.</strong><br>
                        So, what did we do for nearly 250,000 years?
                        We huddled in caves and around small fires, fearful of the things that we didn't understand.
                        It was more than explaining why the sun came up, it was the mystery of enormous birds with
                        heads of
                        men
                        and rocks that came to life.
                        So we called them "gods" and "demons", begged them to spare us, and prayed for
                        salvation.<br>
                        In time, their numbers dwindled and ours rose.
                        The world began to make more sense when there were fewer things to fear, yet the unexplained
                        can
                        never
                        truly go away, as if the universe demands the absurd and impossible.<br>
                        <strong>Mankind must not go back to hiding in fear.</strong><br>
                        No one else will protect us, and we must stand up for ourselves.<br>
                        While the rest of mankind dwells in the light, we must stand in the darkness to fight it,
                        contain
                        it,
                        and shield it from the eyes of the public, so that others may live in a sane and normal
                        world.
                    </p>
                    <h3>We secure. We contain. We protect.</h3>
