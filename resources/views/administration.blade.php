                                        RAISA controls access to classified information, deciding what to redact and
                                        what to reveal.
                                        RAISA also maintains backups of the SCP database, protects documents against
                                        intrusion and infiltration, and monitors inconsistencies in Foundation files to
                                        discern whether the cause is mundane or anomalous.<br>
                                        Foundation employees may encounter notes from RAISA appended to SCP
