                    <p><strong>James Aaron Siegel</strong> is an American scientist who founded the SCP Foundation in
                        the 1800s.
                        Siegel would eventually retire from this position and became O5-1.
                        He fathered Dr. Charles Gears, who would eventually join the Foundation to become one of its
                        most renowned members.</p>
                    <h4>Early life</h4>
                    <p>Aaron Siegel was born in 1866 in Essex County, New Jersey.
                        He eventually became a physicist studying at Cornell University.
                        Siegel was extremely intelligent, becoming a highly renowned scientist at his place of study.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Discovery of the anomalous</h4>
                    <p>Siegel joined several organizations involving the occult, eventually meeting the Gate Guardian in
                        Iraq.
                        Contrary to other commands from the angel, the Guardian told him to "PROTECT".
                        Siegel disappeared from public record after 1891, possibly founding the SCP Foundation.<br>
                        He sired a child, who would later become known as Dr. Charles Gears.
                        Siegel also discovered a way to expand his lifespan, which allowed him to live well past the
                        average human lifespan.
                        It's possible that he is a shape-shifter, as well; he was spotted as an old man in the company
                        of O5-2 and as a young teenager from security bunker footage.</p>
